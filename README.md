For this assignment, we had to implement Bresenham's line algorithm which is an algorithm that can draw a continuous line segment from a starting point to an end point

It doesn't seem very complicated or significant but you can create some very complex images by joining together line segments like we did in the image. This was some kind of sinusoidal function provided by the professor

This assignment was an exercise on transformation matrices and parametric geometry. Using Bresenham from the previous assignment, we can indeed create some very complicated images like a wireframe representation of a bunch of shapes

The assignment required the submission to include screenshots of the scene from 3 different vantage points. I thought I'd just spin it around instead

I was able to save myself some time with this assignment because I realized that toruses are also spheres:

So once I implemented the torus, I could skip the sphere ðŸ™‚

This one was pretty difficult. This was all about the Phong shading and reflection model, which can make low-poly objects look rounder. Midterms and projects started piling up around this time and I wasn't able to implement everything. It's been a long time so I don't remember what was missing here

This was the final assignment. We had to implement parametric geometry and ray tracing to some extent. Of all the shapes here, no matter what level of zoom, their surface will always appear perfectly smooth. I think I finally got the Phong reflection model to work here as well; you can tell by the specular highlights on the objects. Though, I don't think I did ambient lighting correctly, it looks a little strange

The shadows here was the result of ray tracing

During A4, I was troubleshooting normal vectors on the surface and made a very pretty bubble ðŸ˜Š
